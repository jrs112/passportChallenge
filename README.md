Challenge Tasks:

Demonstrate your knowledge of several technologies, including databases, backend design, and UI/UX by
creating a live-updating tree view as a web application.

● The tree should contain a group of nodes, with a
main (root) node that can have any number of
‘factories’.

● These factory nodes can in turn generate a set
amount of random numbers (up to 15),
represented as child nodes of their respective
factories.

● Factories and children should be created
through some means of user input (right click,
button press, etc) specifying the number of
children to generate (up to 15) and the ranges of
those children.

● Factories should have an adjustable name
assigned to them, be removable, and have an
adjustable lower and upper bound for the
random number generation.

● You may use any programming languages and
front-end design styles of your choosing to
create the project.

● All users should see any changes made to
the tree immediately across browsers
without refreshing or polling.

● The state of the tree should remain
persistent; reloading should not undo any
state.

● All of a factory’s existing child nodes should
be removed upon each new generation.

● Your project should be secure, validate
inputs, and protect against injections.

● Your project should be hosted on the web
using a service such as Amazon AWS or
Heroku to run your submission.

● The project should exhibit both a frontend
and backend codebase built by you.

● Use a database on your backend, not Firebase.

● Please submit your project, link, and source
to the email listed below.
